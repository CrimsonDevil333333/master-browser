## What is Master Browser?

**Master Browser** is a native desktop file operations app built with **Rust + Tauri + Next.js** focused on:

- fast file navigation,
- low-level raw partition inspection,
- integrated terminal execution,
- in-app code/text editing,
- production-safe daily operations (copy/move/delete/rename/create).

No mock data paths are used for core actions — operations are wired to real backend commands.

## ✅ Core Features

### 1) Filesystem Explorer
- Navigate directories with direct path input.
- Multi-select with:
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + Click` → toggle item selection
  - `Shift + Click` → range selection
- Actions:
  - copy / move / paste
  - delete
  - rename
  - create file
  - create folder
- Right-click context menu (Explorer):
  - Open, Rename, Copy, Move, Delete, New File, New Folder, Paste.

### 2) Integrated Editor
- Monaco-based editor with syntax support for common source/text formats.
- Dirty-state tracking (`SAVED / UNSAVED`).
- Unsaved-change leave confirmation.
- `Ctrl/Cmd + S` save shortcut.

### 3) Integrated Terminal
- In-app command execution from current explorer path.
- Command history via arrow keys.
- Run-state lock to avoid overlapping command issues.
- Terminal command cancellation for long-running commands.

### 4) Dashboard + Telemetry
- Drive cards with capacity/free-space indicators.
- Live status presentation in UI shell.

### 5) Raw Probe
- Raw block-device inspection flow integrated via Rust backend parser module.
- Current mode: filesystem signature + metadata inspection (not full cross-OS mount/write yet).

### 6) Restored Power Features
- **Chronology**: real recent-file timeline from backend (`get_recent_files`).
- **Anchors**: persistent pinned paths for quick workspace jumps.
- **Nexus Scan**: real local-neighbor discovery via host network tables (`ip neigh` / `arp -a`) — no static hardcoded list.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl/Cmd + K` → focus search
- `Ctrl/Cmd + S` → save active file (editor)
- `?` or `Ctrl/Cmd + /` → toggle shortcut panel
- `Esc` → close floating menus/panels
- `Arrow Up/Down` (terminal input) → command history
- `Enter` (terminal input) → execute command

## 🧩 Release Automation

GitHub Actions release pipeline runs on `v*` tags and builds for:
- macOS
- Ubuntu
- Windows

Releases are configured for **automatic publish** (non-draft).

---

## 🔭 Cross-Filesystem Editing Roadmap

Goal: browse/edit files on Ext4/NTFS/Btrfs/XFS across platforms (including Windows) without kernel mounts.

Planned delivery path:
1. Read-only userspace tree browsing per filesystem (starting with Ext4).
2. Safe write transactions with rollback and integrity validation.
3. Unified explorer actions against mounted + raw partitions.

## 🛡 Windows Note

For raw physical disk inspection features, launch with **Administrator** privileges.
